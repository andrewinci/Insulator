# Install Insulator

Insulator is a JVM application and it is packaged and supported for Mac os, Ubuntu and Windows.

The application automatically updates it self to the latest release at launch, but from time to time, it is
better to download the latest bootstrap from github.

All the required files to make Insulator working are in the following folder:

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Insulator`
- Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Insulator/`
- Debian: `~/.config/Insulator/`
